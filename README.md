# Train-Test
Splitting data between trained and tested to see which model fits best according to R-squared value.

Creating randomized data, splitting the data to testing and training. 

Adding an 8th degree polynomial to predict data for both testin and training data (which have a very low r-squared value)

Changing the polynomial to 7 resulted in better predictions.
